Ever wanted a pocket sized Tetris that you could whip out anytime you wanted?  Well you are in luck.  This build usues an ATTiny85 to run Tetris on an OLED SDD1306 screen.  It's tiny but definitely usable and did I mention it's ridiculously fun to play!

You'll find all of the files in this repository to build your own


I've also done a step by step guide on Instructables in case you are new to this type of thing.  It's takes you through the build and programming the ATTiny85
